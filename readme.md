Conflict exercise

This repo has two branches:

master
feature/x

Your goal: You want master to contain all the work from `feature/x` (and all the work from master).

To accomplish your goal you should:

1. Fork this repository
2. Clone your fork to your local computer
3. Use git lola to visualize the present state
4. Draw a picture with pen and paper of the desired end state
5. Google for the correct command to transition from present state to desired state
6. Run your command
7. Run git lola to see resultant state
8. Compare the result to the picture you drew. Did the command you ran behave like you thought it would?
9. Force push the updated feature/x branch to GitHub

*** Note: Force push can be dangerous. You should never use it on shared branches. ***
